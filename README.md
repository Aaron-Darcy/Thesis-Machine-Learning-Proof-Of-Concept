# Research in Computing with Emerging Technology: Sensor Data Preprocessing Pipeline

## Description

This repository contains the proof of concept for the "Research in Computing with Emerging Technology" module. This concept has been developed as a Google Colab notebook, focusing on the preprocessing of sensor data. The main goal is to demonstrate a preprocessing pipeline that prepares sensor data for further analysis. The results of these preprocessing steps have already been saved within the Colab notebook file.
